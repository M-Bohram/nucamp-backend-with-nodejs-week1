# Backend with Nodejs (Week 1 - workshop code)

This is the code used in Workshop 1 in the Backend with Nodejs course.

## Here is how it is structured:

You should do the following to start the server:
1. Make sure your terminal's pointing path is the project path.
2. You need to install the dependencies first, make sure you are in the right path first: `npm install`
3. You can start the server: `node index.js`

That's it.
